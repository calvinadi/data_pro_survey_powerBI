# Data Professional Survey Analysis in Power BI

[Data Source](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx)

## From the analysis I did, I get some insights which is: 

* From 630 survey takers, Python is the most used programming language that is used by data professionals around the world, further I got to know that the data analyst professionals use it the most.
* Almost more than half survey takers choose 'neither easy nor difficult' to break into data. Probably, because sometimes clients provide datasets that are easy to analyze, while other times they provide datasets that are challenging to analyze.
* Even though India have a lot of programmers and data enthusiast, they have low average score for 'Happiness with work/life balance' and 'Happiness with Salary'.
* More than half of survey takers are Data Analyst (381 from 630). However, their 'Happiness with Salary' score is only 4.49. Possibly because Data Analysts may be underpaid relative to other data professionals, such as Data Scientists and Data Engineers. Some company maybe also make their Data Analysts do some jobs which is part of Data Scientists or Data Engineers, and it will make them unhappy.
* Interestingly, Data Scientist, which have the highest average salary, have only 29.80 average age (25 Data Scientist from 630 survey takers). While, Database Architect or Database Developer have average age more than 30, with salary much lower than Data Scientist ($94k yearly average for Data Scientist, $64k yearly average for Data Architect, and $33k yearly average for Database Developer).
